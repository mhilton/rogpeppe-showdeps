usage: showdeps [flags] [pkg....]

showdeps prints Go package dependencies of the named packages, specified
as in the Go command (for instance ... wildcards work), one per line.
If no packages are given, it uses the package in the current directory.

By default it prints direct dependencies of the packages (and their tests)
only, but the -a flag can be used to print all reachable dependencies.

If the -from flag is specified, the package path on each line is followed
by the paths of all the packages that depend on it.

If the package argument to the -why flag is in the standard library,
the -std flag is implied. The -why flag can also specify Go-command-style
... wildcards.

  -T	exclude test dependencies
  -a	show all dependencies recursively (only test dependencies from the root packages are shown)
  -from
    	show which dependencies are introduced by which packages
  -stdlib
    	show stdlib dependencies
  -why string
    	show only packages which import directly or indirectly the specified package (implies -a and -from)
