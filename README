usage: showdeps [flags] [pkg....]

showdeps prints Go package dependencies of the named packages, specified
as in the Go command (for instance ... wildcards work), one per line.
If no packages are given, it uses the package in the current directory.

By default it prints direct dependencies of the packages (and their tests)
only, but the -a flag can be used to print all reachable dependencies.

If the -from flag is specified, the package path on each line is followed
by the paths of all the packages that depend on it.
  -T=false: exclude test dependencies
  -a=false: show all dependencies recursively
  -from=false: show which dependencies are introduced by which packages
  -stdlib=false: show stdlib dependencies
